> This project is not done yet. Take it with a grain of salt.

This is an overview of my work - **Graph-of-Models**. In this page I only describe the final core concept and implementation.

If you want to read further about this work, about the progress of making it, from the very vague idea to the obstacles I have to tackle. I provide the source code and the post series at **Links** section.

### Blog Series

> Blog Series: [Linh's Logbook - GoM](https://vtrnnhlinh.github.io/blog/tag/gom/).

In this series, posts are usually divided into 3 categories:

- **Literature Review**: It's clear on the title of the post, these posts are heavily theoritical. The point of them is helping me understand the works in this field more. Only reading makes me skimming and skipping the content I feel hard to absord. I can't ensure I understand them in the correct way, but I said it out loud.
- **Design and Ideas**: These posts have short and vague title and the content is about **my idea**. In these posts, I will try to express my idea and approach, from the overview to divide the idea into substeps, then the approach or flowchart to tackle one by one.
- **Implementation**: These posts have ridiculous long title. It will have my stories when coding the idea. I mainly describe what happened, my thoughts, results and reflections.
