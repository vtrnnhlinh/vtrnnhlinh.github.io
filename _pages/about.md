My dears,

I am Linh, la la Linh.

Humans are complex creatures, I can't define myself with some kinds of nouns. But I think I can provide a vague image.

**A Computer Engineer**. Works with Embedded Systems, Internet of Things (IoT), Static Testing and Machine Learning. More ridiculously, the [thesis](vtrhttps://github.com/vtrnnhlinh/thesis/blob/main/HK242_264_DATN_LVTN_Finish_2111654_2110610.pdf) is in Quantum Computing. You might wonder whether I have a career goal or if I truly know what I love to do. Of course I do! I love C/C++, archlinux and nvim! But I don't mind getting out of my comfort zone. *Veni, vidi, vici!* I see, I come, I conquer!

**A Book Dragon**. Has her own piles of books to hoard and to protect :dragon_face:. I surf on the flow of history with classics, on the adventure with Gandalf to Middle Earth, sip the coffee at Book Club.

**A Hopeless Soul**. Chases the beauty in cultures, languages and lullabies. I am learning German and Latin. Besides that, I have a deep love for traditional arts and music.

So welcome to my corner, I will share about whatever I feel like. Sometimes it is a story, sometimes it is a point of view, maybe in a rainy day, it is just a random bunch of paragraphs. But it is my thinking and writing - genuine and authentic.

Don't hesitate to leave a comment if you have something meaningful to ask or to share.

Thank you for visiting this place, between billions of choices on the Internet.

Your new friend,

Linh.
