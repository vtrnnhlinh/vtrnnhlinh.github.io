My dears,

I am Linh, my middle is Nha. My parents named me with the hope I would be an elegant lady.

I have some sides of myself. I will introduce one by one.

A Computer Engineer that works with Static Testing and Machine Learning. The [thesis](vtrhttps://github.com/vtrnnhlinh/thesis/blob/main/HK242_264_DATN_LVTN_Finish_2111654_2110610.pdf) is in Quantum Computing.

A tech nerd that loves C/C++, archlinux and nvim.

A knowledge seeker for cultures and languages, pretty fluent in English, interested in German, Russian, Chinese and Latin.

A hopeless romantic soul that loves our culture, our traditional arts and lullabies.

A bookworm loves LoTR and likes collecting special editions of favorite authors.

So in this blog, I will share maybe all about everything in my world. You can imagine it's like a hotpot, you can find anything in it.

Sometimes it is a story, sometimes it is a point of view, maybe just a random bunch of paragraphs. But it is my genuine thinking and feeling.

I try to divide my contents into 3 categories and mainly written in 2 languages: Vietnamese and English.

Don't hesitate to leave a comment, I am glad to receive interactions from others.

Thank you for visiting my small corner.
