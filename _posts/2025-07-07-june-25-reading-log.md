It was a hard time for myself, after going to work I barely have energy to read. So I am grateful that I finished "White Nights" by Fyodor Dostoevsky. 

But don't worry, I will have a lot of things to continue this series as I have my [Kobo](https://vtrnnhlinh.github.io/blog/2025/my-first-ereader/).

(I said like I have readers, lol)

## 3. White Nights - Fyodor Dostoevsky

The edition I bought actually has 3 short stories of Fyodor, instead of only White Nights. How I can say, the story is deadly hopeless romantic, the writing methods are brilliant, the translations are beautiful.

I can feel and share with the characters of his stories. The relationships are complex and beautiful, the stories inside them are human-like.

> “My God, a moment of bliss. Why, isn't that enough for a whole lifetime?”
