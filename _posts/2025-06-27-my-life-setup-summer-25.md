When I write this, my life is a mess. I am drown in endless fantasies. I write to encourage and clarify for myself. I hope that I can follow what I expect here.

## Routines, Tasks and Mental Health

### RoutineFlow

- Platform: Android
- Download: [RoutineFlow App](https://routineflow.app/)

I highly recommend this app, the author is GOAT. I have used this app since beta, and purchased its lifetime premium after that shortly.

Its clean UI and concept attract me greatly. If you have read [Atomic Habit](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) and want to have an app implemented to work with the principles of this book, this app is for you.

The app is improved through the time, now it is really polished and smooth with template routines and widget.

I use this app for morning and evening routine, mainly for personal hygiene and calm myself down.

### TickTick

- Platform: Cross-Platform
- Download: [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/r?c=pfdhlnyn)

The ultimate core of my system. I have use TickTick for more than 2 years, even though I have slacked off recently. But I am going to renew the yearly subcription soon! I use TickTick for everything and trust me bro, it's the best app out there.

The features are rolled out frequently, the price is acceptable, it is all-in-one you need! Task lists, Timer, Calendar, Habits and now is Countdown!

Some people complaint about the UI but I feel it's okay?

### Tochi

- Platform: Android
- Download: [Tochi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lazyhippo.tochidiary&hl=en-US&pli=1)

It is my Mood tracker, I also bought its lifetime premium. I love one-time payment app ðŸ˜† It's cute, has tags, can attach images and the orbs are cute.

I can track my mood a lot of time through the day. Some apps only allow an input a day.

### 1Money

- Platform: Android
- Download: [1Money](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pixelrush.moneyiq)

As I researched it seems has some drama around the app? But tbh I don't care, the app is solid enough to track your money expense. The UI is clean and the functions is enough.

## Self-Study

### ChatGPT

- Platform: Cross-Platform
- Download: Everyone knows it ðŸ˜„

I guess this is kinda like a love-hate relationship? Sometimes I feel I depend on it, sometimes it helped me a lot. Recently, I find out I can be open with it more! I have spent a lot of my time talking with AI, from AI chatbot service for your fantasies to AI like BingAI or ChatGPT. I think that using it as an assistant, you provide options, I am the one who decide is good.

### Obsidian

- Platform: Cross-Platform
- Download: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)

It's a famous and powerful free tool. It's very beneficial when you know Markdown and community plugins. I can sync my Zotero notes with Obsidian. But ye, after finishing the Thesis, I deleted Zotero lol. 

I think beside storing your notes with easy markdown, I love the Spaced Repition of Obsidian. Unlike Anki, which I usually don't like because the flashcards can be out of context, I can make flashcards from my note with Obsidian. Works very well tho.

### Languages

For English, my biggest problem is Speaking Skill. I use [**Elsa Speak**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.nobarriers.elsa&hl=vi&gl=US&pli=1) for this. I have a Lifetime Elsa Pro account. The Premium version has AI features but I don't think it's necessary. I only need to enhance my pronunciation.

And with German, beside having a small textbook, I also use [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/), again, a lifetime premium account. Memrise has a lot of updates recently, I think it's a solid app. I also used Busuu before, but after the yearly subcription, I didn't extend it. Just because I am lazy, not because of the app. I think it's also a good app for you to try. Duolingo? I stop using Duolingo as the free version is so limited and frustrated.

### MOOC

Coursera is my go-to solution as I bought a Plus subcription :laughing:. I think it's more academic than Udemy. I have Harmonica and Calculus courses on Udemy but haven't finished (yet).

I have some Python-related and Embedded Systems-related courses on Coursera right now. Hopefully I can finish some in this summer.

## Work

Here I am, in the ecosystem of Microsoft.

### MS Todo

MS Todo is a poor todo app to me comparing to my dear Ticktick. But it's also not so bad with My Day feature. I guess it's the only thing TickTick should adapt, Do Day is different than Due Day.

Also, when you flag an Outlook email, it will appear in Todo, which helps you keep track of emails you need to take action.
