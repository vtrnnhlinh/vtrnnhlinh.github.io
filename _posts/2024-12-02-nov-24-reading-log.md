Don't ask me why only one book. I don't know.

## 31. Chùa đàn - Nguyễn Tuân 

It's my first re-read of this masterclass from my dear Nguyen. And it's still the best in my eyes. I believe this work describes Nguyen perfectly, from Nguyen artist to Nguyen human. I don't love him just because his artistic's style is similar to mine. I love him because I can empathize his writing and his life as whole.
