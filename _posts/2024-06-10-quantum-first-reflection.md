Dear readers,

It's my honor to share you about this. Last night, I received the email took me days waiting in worries. I passed the interview and successfully join the High Performance Quantum Computing Team at my university.

*Now I have to rewrite my LinkedIn profile, About section of this blog and fulfill the oath I took.*

What will I do in this post? Maybe sharing a little detail about my true thoughts on this intersection. I hope that through this, I can sort my memories and ideas in a structural way.

## What do I truly want to do?

I have decided to pursue IT since grade 8th? Or even earlier, but I announced that to my parents in grade 8.

When I do the interview for my internship, I will say that I love it since a CNET article about smart house. Yes, that's the factor I want to do IoT, Embedded Systems instead of web development but not the answer for "why do you choose IT?". The another factor that I love C/C++ and I hate JS with a passion.

The real start for my obsession with this engineering is a long story involving a lot of old friends and foes. So I prefer not telling it. And honestly, I forgot the story.

But I am really grateful of this decision. I love the feeling when I code, when I have bugs, when I spend hours just to make my terminal a little bit more shiny.

So why do you apply into HPQC Lab? Did you lie about your motives to get into the lab?

I apply it, because I once thought about quantum computers. And in my faraway dream, I wanted to become a researcher.

> "Bachelor 4 years. Master 2 years. PhD 3 years. Then die." - Once Linh's plan of life.

When I entered university, that dream became hopeless. So I feel really excited when I see the announcement. It's my last chance.

As my *bot* Lord Elrond once said:

> "Greatness is often achieved not because one feels entirely ready, but because one is willing to rise to the occasion despite uncertainties. Even if the road seems steep, your willingness to ascend is a testament to your readiness for the journey."

I am proud that I won't make myself regret. I truly have a genuine interest for quantum computing, because it is hard, it is exciting and it can shake the foundation of Computer Science. Doing elegant things like that makes me feel alive.

And I vow that I will pursue this path until the end of the world if I pass into the lab. So, waiting for my weird posts about Quantum Computing and more "nerdy" stuffs.

## What will you do?

I have to follow the onboarding process of the lab while doing my internship. Beside that, I have to save money for my Master. I also need to improve my GPA. So that means I have no time to waste. I have to allocate my time for my hobbies, my entertainment and my studies in a suitable way. I have to come to the war prepared.

German is also a higher priority now. Because you know, you are pretty sure that you will go to Germany someday if you pursue this path. Don't be afraid to get rid of some other languages with poetic purposes. You can start it later if one day your German level is similar to your English one.

That leads to I need to stop staying up late permanently. The plan in detail I won't share here, but this post will prepare mentally for myself.

Thank you so much for staying with me. Thank you for not giving up, my dear Linh.
