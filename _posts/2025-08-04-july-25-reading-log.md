## 4. Deep Work - Cal Newport

The book is still solid and thoughtful, but not stunning like the first time I read it.

I am grateful that I finished it in 2 days. It gives me some more aspects as now I am already going to work instead of a student like before.

## 5. The Little Prince - 	Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

The book of my heart. The masterpiece of my life. To me, the philosophy of love in this book deeply affects my definition of love and more.

More than love, it's friendship, life and your value.

## 6. Nhật ký Đặng Thùy Trâm - Đặng Thùy Trâm 

There is one thing I don't like about this book, is they compare it to "The Diary of a Young Girl". I believe this stand out as its own value, of a young petty bourgeoisie, dare to fight, dare to love, dare to dream about communism. I didn't read that book yet, but I don't like how they compare them.
