This month I went through a big shock, my mind has been empty. So I didn't meet my reading target. 

## 21. Di tim ban sac tieng Viet - Trinh Sam

Oh well, actually I didn't remember much about this book. It seems a normal read? I should update reading log after finishing a book, not wait until end of the month.

Next month, I hope I can finish the book from my dear General Secretary and one of big four from China.
