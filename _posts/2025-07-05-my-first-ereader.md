I am very happily to announce that, after months of wanting to have an ereader, I finally have one: [Kobo Clara Colour](https://gl.kobobooks.com/de/products/kobo-clara-colour).

I bought an used one from a cute girl. The conditions of the Kobo is very good, excellent :laughing:

## Reading Experience

I tried to use [NickelMenu](https://github.com/pgaskin/NickelMenu) and [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) but feels not so suitable with myself. I keep the vanilla version.

The tip that you will read the KOReader tutorial first, then NickelMenu tutorial to install.

This Feature Settings is **must-have**:

```yaml
[FeatureSettings]
ExcludeSyncFolders=(\\.(?!kobo|adobe).+|([^.][^/]*/)+\\..+)
```

### Vanilla settings

- Natural Light settings is a great one, I set **AUTO** with bedtime is 10PM
- **Pocket** will be ended its lifetime soon, so I suggest you not to bother about it.

### Screensavers

My screensavers! Here Rin from Laid-Back Camp.

The dimension for you is `1072x1488`. Here is your guide:

1. Connect your Kobo with your computer
2. Get into `.kobo` folder and create a folder named `screensaver`
3. Put your pictures into with `1072x1488` dimension and `.png` shortcut
4. Eject and voila~

### Notations!

There are two types of markings in Kobo. First is highlight and second you can mark the whole page. To whole page, you tap the right upper corner. About highlight, we have 4 colors: yellow, purple, blue and green.
- **Yellow**: main points and ideas of the book.
- **Purple**: Romantic moments :3
- **Blue**: Interesting points but not directly related to the content of the books
- **Green**: Interesting information that I want to proofcheck or dig deeper, like a name of a book or some human.

## Ebooks!

I prioritize `,epub` format with a lot of pirate ahoy sites. But of course as an old soul, I can find a lot of books I need at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

My Ereader has no problems with reading mangas, but the native reader of Kobo doesn't support the metadata of `.cbz` files, which prevented me to use it, I can't stand "Unknown Author" :triumph:.

To send books to your Kobo, use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/), you can fetch metadata and book cover from it!
