Due to Lunar New Year holiday, I only read one :laughing:

## 7. A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking

Not really my first time reading this one, the last time I read, it took me a lot of effort to finish :smile:. Now it's easier for me to read it, but not really grab all everything. Something I feel sad that the book lacks the mathematical proof so sometimes I feel missing something.

Rate: :star::star::star::star:
