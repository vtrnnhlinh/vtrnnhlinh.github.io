## 25. Di chuc cua chu tich Ho Chi Minh

His vision is exordinary, his heart is bigger than anything else. His will is for humanity, for peace, for Vietnam.

## 26. Nang cao dao duc Cach mang, quet sach chu nghia ca nhan - Ho Chi Minh 

I re-read this book every year, even though I am not an officer or have any glorious title. I read this book to remind me about the self I want to become. It's not about Communist or not, it's about a proper human-being.

## 27. Tuyen tap Nguyen Tuan 2 - Nguyen Tuan

I finally read "Ha Noi ta danh My gioi". I don't think I have enough words to resonate with him, the soul I believe we have too much things in common. Always the best in my heart :heart:.

## 28. So tay viet van - To Hoai

A collection of To Hoai's thoughts about writing. You can see it's not only about talent but also hard work. I think this book is really worth it.

## 29. Duong cach menh - Ho Chi Minh

It's suprisingly easier to read than I expect. The way my greatest man explain is really easy to understand and I have some more interesting understandings about history.

## 30. Dao - Osho

This isn't a new read. I was shocked by this book before. After this re-read, I wasn't shocked like before, but still a fresh view about Tao. And now I am more mature and realize that: this is a view about Tao of Osho. It doesn't mean Tao is actually like that, I will have my own explaination and view of it.
