I submitted the hardcover of my Thesis to my Faculty, so what will I do in near future? I once shared some details in this post <d-footnote><a href ="https://vtrnnhlinh.github.io/blog/2024/quantum-first-reflection/">Quantum first reflection</d-footnote>.

But I think there are a lot of changes comparing to the post, so I will share some details, to clarify myself and give you some more information.

## past

I believe I didn't contribute much in my Thesis. That it prevents a lot of my vision if I pursue further education. My GPA is also too low in academic standard.

I lost a lot of interests in academic and quantum computing after doing my internship at BGSV. The feeling when you receive your paycheck or doing with C in Static Testing is far more pleasant.

I feel like I prefer the environment that I have to sit (more than) 8 hours a day. So maybe I won't learn master, at least for now. But I also have other plans.

## current

I am researching about Mixture-of-Experts at company. At university, I still don't graduate yet, still have some subjects left.

My plan is focusing on my work at Bosch and gain some certificates on Coursera. After the internship, I expect to make 2 CVs: one in Static Testing and one in Machine Learning.

## future

I want to pursue another bachelor degree, maybe in Linguistics or Psychology, still not decide yet.

Mathematics is also an aspect I believe I should spend time on.
