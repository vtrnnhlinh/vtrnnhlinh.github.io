## 7. Hoang máº¡c Tarta - Dino Buzzati

To me, this book is **an absolute masterpiece**. About words and the art, it's enough, not too fancy to be stunned, not too little to furrow my eyebrows. But it's enough and balance, between the haunting beauty of the landscapes and the inner war of main protagonist. About the story, is it an epic story? No, or even it's slightly a peaceful-but-hopeless tragedy. But why do I consider it a masterpiece? Cause I can see myself in it. It's like someone bang the pagoda's bell next to my ear. It shakes my soul, makes me can't stop reading to finish within 2 days. I had to take a reflection to make myself different than the main character.
