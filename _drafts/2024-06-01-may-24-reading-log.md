I read less this month cause my internship started.

## 15. Chuyen nghe - Nguyen Tuan

No doubt, I will give this book an absolute 5 stars.

This is a book, we have a lesser artistic Nguyen, but a more serious one with more personal opinions. He knows what he is thinking and what he wants. Not all people can do that.

Through the book, I understand him more than ever.

## 16. Hoa ban do - Huu Mai

I bought this one because the 70th year of Dien Bien Phu Victory. This is a movie I have watched when I was a little girl. It has an huge impact on my politics view. But it's sad to admit that, this book isn't good. I don't know if it's horrible or I am just a worse person than before?
