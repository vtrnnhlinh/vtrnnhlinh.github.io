It's about a month since the first day I start my internship. I learned a lot and experience a lot from my company, so it worth sharing, I believe so.

## how I feel?

I feel great and alive when I come to the company, it's really an experience. My mentor and other people in the company deserve my respect. You know, I am a stoopid, horrible person. But I have standards, and if I sense you don't reach that bar, I can't communicate with you even though you are maybe better than me. I feel really relieved and lucky that my mentor is really great. He is hardworking, serious, experienced and beside that, a gentleman. He don't make me feel ashamed and make me feel more confident to voice my idea. I am really grateful for this opportunity.

## what I learn?

All I did during this one month is I can catch and analyze the protocol of the display. The rest is a disaster. This destroyed my over-confidence. Oh, I also improved my abilities to reading source code and immigrated the code to a newer sdk.

My skill with makefile also increased a lot. I still can remember my first day at work, I am really overwhelmed by the 400-line makefile. The last one I see is 10 lines, written by Linh. :laughing:

`volatile` and stuffs, things I can't imagine I will use one day, but I will and it's necessary to do so. Not some useless demonstration.

Beside that, I also learn how to use a cafe machine. I love my coffee and tea at office, they are all top notch quality.

## what I did?

I moved from VSC to neovim. I think it's a game changer for me. The experience on nvim is far better than on VSC :)

I also had to reinstall ubuntu twice in 3 days. Won't say it's a great experience! That also made me moving from edge to brave and discover that thunderbird mail is not ugly like the last time I saw it! Decided to use it instead of gnome mail or whatever.

I will write one more post at the end of my internship. Feel free to ask if you have any questions.
