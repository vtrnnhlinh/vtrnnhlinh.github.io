Hope I can keep this series stable. After yesterday, I received some valuable feedback from one of my supervisors, have to admit, I can't get all of his words. But at least I tried. Today I want to grind QGSS24 challenges and read a paper about circuit-cutting.

## Planning

I have 2 main tasks for today:

- [x] Read a paper about circuit cutting (Not finished but made progress)
- [x] Grind lab 1 of QGSS (Made progress, maybe will change tactics)

I received thoughtful response from my supervisor about yesterday's paper, he even gave me more papers related to that topic to read. And I feel like it isn't really relate to me. So I still keep track of the links he sent, I don't think I will dig deeper but will try to broaden my view.

## First task: Read a paper about circuit cutting

I have found this paper: [Clifford-based Circuit Cutting for Quantum Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10788). God knows if it's a good one or not, but I think I will try to get most of it. I should make progress, not just some shallow introduction, specially when I decide to choose circuit cutting as my main topic.

I don't know the heck is Clifford circuit but the paper has a section about Quantum Computing Fundamentals. *Amen*, God favors you my authors.

My supervisor sent me the published version of that paper, he said it's a good one. I will grind this updated version instead of the old one.

## Second task: QGSS24 

I am still struggling with lab 1 of QGSS, I mean I even don't reach lab 1 content yet and don't know how to submit the work yet. The code in the slide seems not so up-to-date. I am seriously thinking about do first, learn later.

At least I found the GitHub repo of it. Going to figure out how to run Jupyternotebook on nvim first :joy: *What did I do to my life?*

Some trivia details, I am really anxious when seeing strangers or even messaging my supervisors first. Last time when we had a meeting, I even didn't say anything. That made my supervisors felt confused. I know I need to be more active and responsible but I just can't. I am trying slowly to be more open and confident. Hope it will work.
