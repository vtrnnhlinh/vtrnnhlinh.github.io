After the last post reflecting on my actions in battling with datasets, I find out it will be not effective in large-scale. So here I am, in the light of the day, digging **Knowledge Graph (KGs)** again.

## What is it now?

To save time and effort, as if applicable to my real-life job, training models isn't my sh*t, so I have to find easiest way for me to save resources and energy. I plan to use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to train my models. Because the focus of my work is isn't in the power of models but how they graph and connect all together.

But my current focus will be about **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to processing the datasets
