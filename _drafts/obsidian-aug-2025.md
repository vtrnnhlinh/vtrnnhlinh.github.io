It was a long time since I start using Obsidian again, only when I recognize that I can install Obsidian on my company laptop without admin rights :skull:. I decide to give myself a fresh start, let check out what we will install and take it cool :sunglasses:.

## Theme

My choice is **gruvbox**, always **gruvbox**, **gruvbox** is da bezt.

There are a lot of great great choices about themes on Obsidian, but keep in mind to make it simple or you can be overwhelmed.

## Setup 

### Vanilla

First thing to do ever when you use Obsidian: `Files & Links > Automatically update internal links: ON`

Then check out the Daily Note and prepare the template. You can consider mine:

```md
---
tags:
  - "#daily"
  - "#journal"
date: "{{date}}"
---

## Top 3 Goals

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

## TickTick Sync

- Todayâ€™s Tasks: 
    - [ ] 
    - [ ]  
    - [ ] 
- Overdue:
    - [ ] 
## Log

**07:00 Morning Reflection:**  

- Feeling:
- Main focus:
- Distraction to avoid:

**19:00 Evening Reflection:**  

- What did I do well today?
- What was unfinished?
- Whatâ€™s the priority tomorrow?

## Notes

```

I avoid creating too much folders, as we can structure the notes through tags and links. Why? I believing creating too much folders will make friction to my creating notes as I have to choose which folder I should put the note on. Without folders and only tags, I can use shortcut to quickly create notes, and I can apply templates to have pre-fined tags and structure for each specialised note. I have 2 folders, one is for **Templates** and one is for **Daily** as I can automate Daily folder.

### Community Plugins

First one is **Dataview**, I use this to have an overview for my reading list. The useful resource is [Examples - Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/resources/examples/).

Second one is **Spaced Repition**. This plugin makes Obsidian more lively and more interactive. With this plugin, you can review knowledge easier without using a seperated flashcard app like Anki or Quizlet.
