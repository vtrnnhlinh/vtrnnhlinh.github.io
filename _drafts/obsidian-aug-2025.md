It was a long time since I start using Obsidian again, only when I recognize that I can install Obsidian on my company laptop without admin rights :skull:. I decide to give myself a fresh start, let check out what we will install and take it cool :sunglasses:.

## Theme

My choice is **gruvbox**, always **gruvbox**, **gruvbox** is da bezt.

There are a lot of great great choices about themes on Obsidian, but keep in mind to make it simple or you can be overwhelmed.

## Setup 

### Controls & Settings

First thing to do ever when you use Obsidian: `Files & Links > Automatically update internal links: ON`

Then check out the Daily Note and prepare the template. You can consider mine:

```md

tags:
  - "#daily"
  - "#journal"
date: "{{date}}"

## Log

**07:00 Morning Reflection:**

- Main focus:
- Distraction to avoid:

**19:00 Evening Reflection:**  

- What did I do well today?
- What was unfinished?
- Whatâ€™s the priority tomorrow?

## Notes

```

I avoid creating too much folders, as we can structure the notes through tags and links
