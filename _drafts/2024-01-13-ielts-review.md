Finally, I got my IELTS certificate. Even though I got a normal result (6.5), but I guess this is a fun journey to share.

## Preparation

First step for every exam is preparation, but I didn't register to learn at any English center. I feel like it's actually a *scam*. So I got my self-study plan.

### Prepare for the exam itself

In my mind, English is always a language. We study it to communicate not to do exam. So I don't want to or don't have time to try hard for the exam. But you have to realize that, you enter a game, you must get the rules.

So to grab the requirements and format of the exam, I learn from 2 main sources:

1. [Fastrack IELTS](https://fastrackielts.com/): An English course from a 8.5 teacher, even though I didn't finish all the courses but I think it's an actually good one.
2. [The Official Cambridge Guide to IELTS Student's Book](https://www.fahasa.com/the-official-cambridge-guide-to-ielts-student-s-book-with-answers-with-dvd-rom.html): A book that everyone deserves!

Beside, I recommend [IELTS Advantage](https://www.youtube.com/@Ieltsadvantage) Youtube channel. They have a lot of useful tips and tricks.

### Speaking Preparation

This is my most weakness skill. I only got 5.5 for Speaking :laughing:. So maybe my advice for this one won't be so legit. I have a lot of pronunciation problems. Here are my resources:

1. [Elsa Speak](https://elsaspeak.com/en/): This app is already very popular. And its quality worth that.
2. Playlist [The Sound of English](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD6B222E02447DC07) by BBC.

On another hand, you can join some foreign Discord servers to improve your real life English communication.

### Writing & Reading Preparation

To be honest I didn't prepare much for 3 left skills, but I guess I can give some recommendations.

- [Write & Improve](https://writeandimprove.com/) from Cambridge: There are topic tasks for you to do, the website will score and give advice. But if you want to do IELTS tasks, you have do to some payments, I guess so.
- [Oxford Learnerâ€™s Pocket Phrasal Verbs And Idioms](https://www.fahasa.com/oxford-learner-s-pocket-phrasal-verbs-and-idioms.html) and related books: Offer a wide range of elegant words, but need to know how to use them with other tools to maximize the effiency.
- [Grammar - British Council](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar): Too legit to introduce anything.
- [Vocabulary](https://www.vocabulary.com/): a kinda advanced page about vocabulary.

### Listening Preparation

Maybe we only need to watch Youtube a lot for this skill? I will introduce some channels have short and meaningful videos.

- [Project Better Self](https://www.youtube.com/@ProjectBetterSelf): self help and self improvement channel
- [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/@crashcourse): medium-length videos, have a lot of knowledge to entertain your brain
- [TedED](https://www.youtube.com/@TEDEd): I guess you already know this channel

If you love listening, you can check out [Cal Newport](https://www.youtube.com/@CalNewportMedia) in your free time. I love his books a lot. I don't recommend TED because their topics recently focus on social sciences or politics, which I hate with a passion.

## Exam Day 

I took the test on 26th Dec which is in my endterm exam period. So I feel really exhausted and don't really motivated to do the exam. I register to take the exam at IDP Hai Ba Trung.

In case of unwanted accidents, I go to the site pretty early. I took the Speaking exam in the morning and the rest in the afternoon.
