So half of the year passed, I didn't read 24/48 but only 20. Let see what I have done this month.

## 17. The Stoic Path: The Golden Sayings - Epictetus

It was a tough read. But fruitful at the end. Maybe one day I will consider it as my bible? My cousins teared 2 sheets of the book apart. I feel like I wanted to rip them off. I fixed it, but still.

## 18. The Perks of Being a Wallflower - Stephen Chbosky

One of the greatest books I ever read this year. I even share some shit posts on Threads because I can't stop my feelings when finishing it. It's pure wonderful. The book is really mentally heavy, but the words, the way the author wrote it. Just very elegant and poetic. You can feel the sophistificated human, but it's not overload that burn your mind. I love this book so so much.

## 19. Muon mau lap luan - Nguyen Duc Dan

It's not an astonishing read, but a decent one. The book makes me differentiate scientific, logical arguments with social ones. I am not sure I use the right words, but it's just I know what's wrong with my arguments sometimes. This series never fail to impress me.

## 20. The Caves of Steel - Isaac Asimov

I got why my dear Tolkien loves Asimov, cause I love him too! Number 1 American writer in my heart. Of course, the only American writer I can enjoy. It's really interesting read. The characters have the depth builds and the problems of the novel is great. I wanted to have his The Complete Robot, hoho.
