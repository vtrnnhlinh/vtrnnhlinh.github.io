When I write this, my life is a mess. I am drown in endless fantasies. I write to encourage and clarify for myself. I hope that I can follow what I expect here.

## Routines, Tasks and Mental Health

### RoutineFlow

- Platform: Android
- Download: [RoutineFlow App](https://routineflow.app/)

I highly recommend this app, the author is GOAT. I have used this app since beta, and purchased its lifetime premium after that shortly.

Its clean UI and concept attract me greatly. If you have read [Atomic Habit](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) and want to have an app implemented to work with the principles of this book, this app is for you.

The app is improved through the time, now it is really polished and smooth with template routines and widget.

I use this app for morning and evening routine, mainly for personal hygiene and calm myself down.

### TickTick

- Platform: Cross-platform
- Download: [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/r?c=pfdhlnyn)

The ultimate core of my system. I have use TickTick for more than 2 years, even though I have slacked off recently. But I am going to renew the yearly subcription soon! I use TickTick for everything and trust me bro, it's the best app out there.

The features are rolled out frequently, the price is acceptable, it is all-in-one you need! Task lists, Timer, Calendar, Habits and now is Countdown!

Some people complaint about the UI but I feel it's okay?

### Tochi

- Platform: Android
- Download: [Tochi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lazyhippo.tochidiary&hl=en-US&pli=1)

It is my Mood tracker, I also bought its lifetime premium. I love one-time payment app ðŸ˜† It's cute, has tags, can attach images and the orbs are cute.

I can track my mood a lot of time through the day. Some apps only allow an input a day.
