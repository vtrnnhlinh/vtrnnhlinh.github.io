Oh well... Sorry for my disappearance. Mental breakdown is always horrible :blush: So today I have a meeting with my supervisors, I am still preparing for my presentation. So here is today's post for my Thesis.

## Planning

I have 3 main tasks for today:

- [x] Structure and update the papers and resources
- [ ] Prepare presentation
   - [ ] State your concerns
   - [ ] Show what you digged
- [x] Ace the meeting


## Reorganize the squad, ahead the march!

I barely do anything past 2 weeks, so now I need to be calm and grab an overview of what's happening. *You need to know the shit before doing something*.

### Papers I am focusing

I am focusing on *Clifford-based Circuit Cutting for Quantum Simulation*, hoping that I can run the code of them, but I can't find anywhere. Or maybe I wasn't focus enough to see.

### New suggested papers

My supervisors sent some more paper about scheduling, even something called QOS: Quantum Operating System. There is a paper about new way to structure data with graphs, I feel interested and sense there is a connection between it and Quantum.


- Fluxion: A Scalable Graph-Based Resource Model for HPC Scheduling Challenges
- Scaling Quantum Computations via Gate Virtualization
- QOS: A Quantum Operating System
- Integration of Quantum Accelerators into HPC: Toward a Unified Quantum Platform

## Review about the meeting

My teammate took 1 hour 30 minutes to present, while I only took about 5-15min. Feel kinda ashamed if you asked. But at least my direction is appreciated by my supervisors.
I wanted to run the code of papers but I don't know how, so my supervisors told me to run the simple program from Qiskit and PennyAI first.
