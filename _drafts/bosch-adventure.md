My journey with my dream company finally came to an end. It's not a happy ending, or even a little bit of "spicy" but I think it's still a memorial part of my life.

## What I did at Bosch?

I joined a team focusing on **Static Testing** using [*Astree*](https://www.absint.com/astree/index.htm). After about 2 months, I start digging in the AI project. It's like a duality, morning staring at C, afternoon jumping around with Python.
