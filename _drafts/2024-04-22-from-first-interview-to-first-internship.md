My dear readers, I got an internship at the beginning of April. I think I was pretty lucky but still, I think it worth sharing.

## My first interview

At the end of lunar year, a HR from Bosch messaged me on LinkedIn to encourage me applying into a C/C++ intern position. Even though at the end I didn't receive the offer but that made me have a preparation ahead of many friends.

### My CV

As a "traditional" mind, I learn and follow advice from [Harvard College Resumes & Cover Letter Guide](https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/harvard-college-guide-to-resumes-cover-letters/). So it's a very basic, single column CV. I hate fancy and colorful templates on Canva, honestly. I didn't include my GPA because mine is horribly low. I try to impress with my Coursera and IELTS certificates. Hope it works! If you want to have a sneak peak of my CV. Here you come: [LaTeX4Fun/CV](https://github.com/vtrnnhlinh/LaTeX4Fun/blob/main/CV/cv.pdf).

### My first mistake

After sending the CV to the HR, I didn't prepare anything more and continue my wrong routine. 2 days later, the HR called me for a phone interview while I was still snoozing. As you can guess, I came to the battle unprepared, I must left in defeat. Even though at that time, I was still very hopeful that I can pass to next stage of interview, but I was rejected after one week.

But at least, after that call, I immediately head to Coursera and do a small course about interviewing. The course link is here: [Preparation for Job Interviews](https://www.coursera.org/projects/preparation-for-job-interviews). I made an interview cheatsheet for myself and I think it helped me a lot in further journey.

## Next rejected stories

My second interview is... also Bosch. I had a direct technical interview at the Job Fair in my campus. I thought everything went really smooth until the interviewer asked my GPA. My only mistake that day is I didn't print out the CV, only keep the digital one.

My third time is predictable rejection. This time is BanVien company. They only hire Fresher this year, not Intern. I tried my luck but didn't receive the call.

## My first internship

The day after, I saw Vierobot on the Internship site of the Faculty. I immediately sent the CV out. Luckily, I received the email to schedule the interview shortly after that.

I remember that day, I had to wake my roommate up to do the makeup for me. It's really a moment for myself, to feel that I am becoming an adult.

The interview isn't intense and challenging like I expected. It's a small startup company, I won't have great benefits and great work culture like I dream but I can feel the positive atmosphere and the dynamic of youth's dream there. As an intern, I should protitize what I can learn and experience, not the money. So I accepted the offer and I feel like it's one of the greatest decisions I ever have.

So it's a short story like that. I will officially start my internship at the end of May. Good luck for myself!
