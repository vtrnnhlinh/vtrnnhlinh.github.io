I made a significant change to my arch setup, as I switch from KDE to i3wm. It's an entire change from methodology to workflow. So I guess I will make a tour for my new setup.

## Windows Displayer and Manager

I use [**i3wm**](https://i3wm.org/) and [**ly**]() as my Windows Displayer and Display Manager.





## nvim

I am currently using **nvim0.11** and **AstroNvim v5**.
