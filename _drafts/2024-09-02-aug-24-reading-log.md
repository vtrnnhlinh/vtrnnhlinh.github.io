Here is a quick thought about last month.

## 22. Truyen ngan Nguyen Tuan 1 - Nguyen Tuan

He is my dear favorite, I am afraid he will steal first position of Tolkien one day.
His writing is just perfect for me, very healing and interesting. I can see the progress of his thought, the history of a chaotic time reflects in his writing.

## 23. Thep da toi the day - Nikolai Ostrovsky

One of the books I ever re-read. In my young age, it gave me a wonderful boost, it motivated and inspired me a lot. It's not about polictics, but how the main character develops and get through the sh*ts.

And now, it doesn't give me that kind of energy anymore. Cause I understand more about CCCP that time, understand more about the values they are fighting for.

It doesn't really align with the goals of Ho Chi Minh that time. And to me, my dear Uncle Ho is my God, VCP is my Religion. So that made me have less empathy for the work.

But I still appreciate, cry or sob when reading it. It's not about Pavel anymore, it's about my dear General Secretary. I know he loves this work, I know he spent his whole life to fight like Pavel's spirit.

And he did it. And I can't stop thinking about him when I read the book.

There will be more times I read this book, I read to miss a person, I read to resonate with a personality I admire and respect.
