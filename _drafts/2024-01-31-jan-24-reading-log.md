January comes to an end, I will introduce some books I have read in this month. Glad to share with you.

## 1. The Fellowship of the Ring - J.R.R Tolkien

I am a hard fan of Tolkien. Just kidding, but I have a lot of things to share about this work, maybe it's a little obssession of my life. Some years ago, I have read The Hobbit on the Internet, my interest with Tolkien's legendarium started from that day. I have bought LOTR 3 years ago, but my English level that time isn't enough (even now it takes me a lot of effort) so I just feel overwhelmed instead of enjoying. My old boxset was damaged after a storm. Last summer, I randomly saw a beautiful boxset of LOTR at Tan Phu Aeon Mall so... My friend gifted me an old random 3 books of LOTR so I have a chance to give it a try a gain.

And I have to say that, I fall in love with Tolkien. His words is poetic, clean and majestic. The story is well-writen and logical, not some shitty ones I usually read. I will try to finish the rest of the LOTR after buying a wonderful version.

## 2. Thi Nhan Viet Nam - Hoai Thanh, Hoai Chan

To be honest, I don't have a good impression with the book reviewers, mainly cause my idol Nguyen Tuan hate them. But on another side, this is a worthy work of literature.

The authors used suitable words, their writing is artistic and the work itself took a lot of effort that I can't imagine there will be another one to do the job of this book but in another period of time. I secretly have a sad feeling for the authors, but I will keep it for myself.

## 3. Tam li hoc toi pham 2 - Stanton E Samenow

If the first half took me a lot of time to diss on Facebook, this second half makes me feel more mature. It is also very mid and shitty but I don't want to rage quit anymore. It seems very wrong on the scientist aspect. I can't get the part he just gave you random conclusions without proof, just pure observations. This field or this author is purely shitty.

## 4. Cuoc song o trong ngon ngu - Hoang Tue

A book gives me a lot of insights about language structure. It reminds me a lot about LLM or NLP. What I don't like from this book is the author usually relate to politics. Even though I am on his politics side but I don't like a science book talks about something lame like politics.

## 5. Brief Answers to Brief Questions - Stephen Hawking

Wel, this book is entirely out of plan, but I am glad that I bought it (almost starve to ded because of over-budget). There aren't so much physics element but it is still written by a scientist mind. Hawking writes gently and smoothly, explains the fields outside Physics very naturally. That means he has a wide range of knowledge. My brain prompted "This is wisedom" while reading, haha. Hawking writes in a very calm tone but you can feel the ensthustiatism and genius side of him.

Very inspiring and wise book. Highly recommend :joy:

## 6. the art of sleeping - Rob Hobson

This is my third time reading this book. It has a cheap price but the quality of the print and content is just wonderful. I don't use the word "read" but "experience" for this one. From the feeling when you grab the book to the content you get from it, everything is GOAT. The only sad thing is my sleeping routine is still a mess.
