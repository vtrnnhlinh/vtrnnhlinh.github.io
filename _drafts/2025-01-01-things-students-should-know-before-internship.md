Hi everyone, hope it was a nice day to you! During my internship, there are a lot of moments that I just think that "why I didn't know this before?". So here in this post, I will share those with you, hope you can learn something from my mistakes.

But, I want to give you some background information. I worked at a startup company as a Embedded Intern, so maybe there are some details that can't be applicable in your case.

## Email and CV

Before going to work, you have to apply for it. And to apply for job, you have to send email and CV to recruiters. **Write an email in professional way, please**. Have title and thoughtful body to tell what you are applying for.

About CV, at least it should be ATS! I have my CV on LaTeX with Havard style, but it's normal to have a Canva one. Just remember to test if it's scannable. How to write a proper CV also an art. You should research it carefully and prepare it 1-2 months earlier than actual time to apply for internship.

## Git

You know Git, right? You should know its basic commands, how to write commit messages, check in check out branches,... 

Commit messages is important, you are working with people not alone anymore. So be sure people will understand what you are doing

## Write reports and such

When you go to work, it's not only about code, but also write documentations and reports to share information with other people.

Learn how to write it in a logical and thoughtful way. Sometimes you just spend a whole day to read and write documentation.

## Communication

Your soft skills matter. You will have to exchange a lot with your colleagues about the shit we are doing, specially when you need to learn a lot from them.

So learn how to open your mouth to ask questions, to express your ideas clearly, to bond with your colleagues.

That's all, hope it helps ;)
