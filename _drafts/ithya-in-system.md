Hear me out! This one is peak, fr fr. It's like the child of [lofi girl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow) and [studytogether](https://www.studytogether.com/). Even though there is a lot of space for improvement, but I believe the product is already solid and worth every penny. I drop the link here :point_down:

## What do I like about it?

First, the artstyle is very aesthetic :sparkles:. I love the cartoon 2D artstyle. It's good for my one cell brain. 3D is heavier than necessary to an app for productivity.

Second, the gamification motivates me to open my laptop instead of doom-scrolling my phone. I want to be a great mage, weeza!

Third, various of scene makes me imagine every scene of my life fits with action happening on screen, that helps me a lot to focus on study.

Finally, it fits perfectly with my current workstream! It contributes value to my current system, not being an useless addition that contributes nothing but duplicated features with other apps.

## How do I use it?

For productivity, it has 3 main features: Timer, Tasks and Journal. The Journal feature is kinda useless, I only use it to reset the Task list. The Timer feature will make it duplicates with the Pomodoro timer on TickTick. I decide to use Stopwatch on TickTick to start a big task, and with Ithya, I divide it into smaller tasks and use Pomodoro timer of Ithya. Listing out subtasks in Ithya is less frictional than on Ticktick due to its simplicity nature.

The music in this game/app is phenomenal, remember to wear your earphones when using it! The rain effect and the lofi is very calming and inspirational. When studying, I set to scene she studies at home or at library, then in break time I move to nature scene. I enjoy fantasizing myself in that lil cute girl!

## Things can be improved

The Journal feature is suck. Luckily I use Ticktick as main system and this is just a small fantasy motivating myself or I can scream. Heard that they will have a patch update to improve this soon

Some statistic and chart will be satistifying and nice. More customization to the character like hair, skin color will be lovely but not necessary :laughing:

So that is all for the day!
